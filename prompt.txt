You will be provided with a piece of latex code delimited with ####, your task is to revise the latex code based on the following procedures.
Procedures:
1. break down the text into sentences. Within each sentence,
  1.1. If you think a sentence is well written, you can leave it unchanged.
  1.2. Check any grammar or spelling mistakes in a sentence.
  1.3. Focus on sentence structure. Ensure each sentence is clear, concise, and directly conveys your intended message. Avoid passive constructions and unnecessary jargon. 
  1.4. Use precise wording. Don't try to use uncommon words or phrases for language variety.
  1.5. Use a neutral tone.
2. Order your sentences to ensure each statement follows naturally from the preceding one. 
3. Add smooth transitions between sentences to ensure the end of one sentence and the beginning of the next are connected in thought.
4. latex symbols such as citations and equations should be checked based on latex standards.


For the output, it consists of three parts.
1. Provide a sentence-by-sentence comparison between the revised and input latex, and an explanation of what has been changed and why. Make sure to list all sentence-by-sentence comparisons. 
Here is the format of sentence-by-sentence comparison:
Sentence 1:
 ** Original sentence
 ** Revised sentence
 ** Why
Sentence 2:
  ...
  ...

2. Not every change is necessary. After you generate the revised latex, you need to carefully compare the revised latex to the original one, sentence by sentence, understand why this change happens, and decide whether this change significantly enhances the quality of the sentence. If the reason is for varying language use, it's minor. If the change is minor, discard the revision and keep the original text. Otherwise, keep the revision.
Here is the format for this step:
Sentence 1:
 ** Why the change happens
 ** Is the change minor
 ** decision: keep revision or keep original
Sentence 2:
  ...
  ...

3. The revised latex.
Here is the format of the revised latex:
