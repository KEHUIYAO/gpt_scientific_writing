You will be provided with a piece of latex code delimited with ####, your task is to revise the latex code based on the following tips. Make sure the revised text follows all the tips.
Tips:
1. No change is OK. If you think a sentence is well written, you can leave it unchanged.
2. Check any grammar or spelling mistakes in a sentence.
3. Focus on sentence structure. Ensure each sentence is clear, concise, and directly conveys your intended message. Avoid passive constructions and unnecessary jargon. 
4. Arrange ideas logically. Order your sentences and paragraphs in a logical sequence, ensuring each statement follows naturally from the preceding one. 
5. Smooth Transitions Between sentences. Ensure the end of one sentence and the beginning of the next are connected in thought, allowing for seamless reading and a coherent flow of ideas
6, Use precise wording, but avoid using very uncommon words in a certain study field.
7. The text provided is latex, so it contains some latex symbols such as \cite{}, \begin equation ... Those symbols should remain unchanged in the improved text.
8. Revise the text using a neutral tone.



For the output, it consists of three parts.
1. You should provide a sentence-by-sentence comparison between the revised and input latex, and an explanation of what has been changed and why. Make sure to list all sentence-by-sentence comparisons. 
Here is the format of sentence-by-sentence comparison:
Sentence 1:
 ** Original sentence
 ** Revised sentence
 ** Why
Sentence 2:
  ...
  ...

2. Not every change is necessary. After you generate the revised latex, you need to carefully compare the revised latex to the original one, sentence by sentence, understand why this change happens, and decide whether this change significantly enhances the quality of the sentence. If the reason is for varying language use, it's minor. If the change is minor, discard the revision and keep the original text. Otherwise, keep the revision.
Here is the format for this step:
Sentence 1:
 ** Why the change happens
 ** Is the change minor
 ** decision: keep revision or keep original
Sentence 2:
  ...
  ...

3. The revised latex.
Here is the format of the revised latex:
