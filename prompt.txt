Help me rewrite the latex code inside ### following the procedures step by step inside """ . The input is latex code.
The output should be 
1. an improved version of the latex code 
2. a sentence-to-sentence comparison with the original latex and an illustration of why the changes are necessary. Present all sentence-to-sentence comparisons for the input latex.

Procedures:
"""
step 1: For each sentence, check any grammar or spelling mistakes, use precise wording, but avoid using very uncommon words. Make sure the sentence is clear and concise. Avoid passive constructions and unnecessary jargon. Leave the sentence as is if it already meets the standards above.
step 2: For any sentence you've changed, compare to the original sentence, and determine if the change is necessary, if not, keep the original sentence.
step 3: Order the sentences in a logical sequence, ensuring each statement follows naturally from the preceding one.
step 4: Smooth transitions between sentences: ensure the end of one sentence and the beginning of the next are connected in thought, allowing for seamless reading and a coherent flow of ideas.
step 5: For the latex formulas, check the correctness based on latex standard.
